# WEBD 5000 - Final Project

##  e-Portfolio

**Due as posted in Brightspace**
 
### Instructions:  

- Open this repository in the default GitHub Codespace as shown in class.
- Add the Live Server extension to VS Code as shown in class.
- You must ensure that your solution has been pushed to GitHub in order to get credit for the assignment.  
- This is to be an individual assignment (i.e. not group work).
- The **rubric/checklist** on Brightspace **should act as your guide of what to demonstrate in the video**. The video file (or link) should be submitted to **Brightspace** before the deadline.

### Tasks:  

#### NSCC ePortfolio

As part of being a “portfolio college”, NSCC requires all students to produce a portfolio before graduation. A portfolio can come in many forms depending on the student that creates it. Students in the Full Stack Application Development Diploma program are encouraged to develop an electronic portfolio or “e-portfolio”. An e-portfolio is simply a website that allows anyone to view the student’s portfolio of information from the Internet. Your task is to create this website.

To satisfy this requirement you will need to develop several web pages, including:

- A Home Page that provides an introduction to you and your portfolio

- A Contact Page that provides your relevant contact information

- A page describing at least five (5) short-term (2 years) goals for the future

- A page listing at least three (3) your current skills and appropriate descriptions for each skill

- A page for your resume displayed as an HTML document (i.e. not a link to a Word document or PDF)

- (Optional) Other pages that may show documents you want to display (e.g. certificates)

Also, the website must comply with the following guidelines:

- All pages must adhere to HTML5 and CSS3 standards

- All CSS styles will be placed in one or more external CSS files

- No deprecated HTML tags or attributes will be used

- All pages must use Responsive Design and react differently for phones, tablets and desktop browsers

- All source code will be formatted and indented for optimal reading

- HTML tables will only be used to display tabular data not for layout purposes

- A menu will exist on all pages that will allow you to navigate to any web page in the web site

## Submission Instructions
### Video Recording Submission:

You will demonstrate the completion of this project via a **video screen-capture recording** of you navigating your completed Website in the **browser** (e.g. Chrome) and viewing your **code** in the text editor (e.g. VS Code within your GitHub Codespace) to show completion of the rubric/checklist. You will post **either your video file or a link to it** (e,g, a Microsoft Stream recording, make sure to give the instructor permissions to watch it), to the Brightspace Final Project Dropbox prior to the deadline. If you are not sure of how best to capture such a video, seek advice from the instructor prior to the deadline.

NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE AUDIO OR SPEAK DURING THE VIDEO. HOWEVER, IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO, THEN YOUR VIDEO MUST VERY CLEARLY SHOW EVERYTHING IN THE RUBRIC/CHECKLIST AS THERE WILL BE NO AUDIO TO TELL WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SHOWING IN A GIVEN STEP.
